                <h2>Initiation</h2>
                <p>
                    When deciding which content packages I found interesting, I searched for words that may evoke a
                    feeling to determine the overall experience. The environment and the web stood out to me as I could
                    play with an earthly tone or a technological approach. In the end, I chose "Theorizing the Web 2018"
                    as I wanted to represent the interrelationship of the web and people through interactions within the
                    poster. First, I created a mood board to find compelling layouts, hierarchy, and approaches to
                    deliver the content's voice through design.

                <h2>Sketching</h2>
                <p>
                    I looked further into the organization's website and how they designed posters for their event. The
                    canvas filled with imagery and emphasized words "Theorizing" and "2018" gave me a sense of direction
                    in what to prioritize in the poster. I drew sketches of possible layouts that play with layering or
                    scale. For the term 'theorizing,' I imagine a scenario of uncovering the unknown. I wanted to play
                    with fluctuating colours when hovering over the letters to allow interaction and discovery.
                    Moreover, I chose a pixel monospace to display technology and sans-serif to have a human feel.

                <h2>Figma Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    When designing on Figma, I wanted to illustrate two pages. One page is the landing, while the second
                    presents all the information and calls to action. Since the poster is solely typographical, I
                    decided to use asterisks and slashes to add texture and detail, filling the space with a computing
                    aesthetic.

                <p>
                    From black & white to colour, I found this transition intimidating. I felt the white space around
                    the text made the overall poster look empty and flat. As I shifted towards a dark-mode approach, I
                    believe it best depicts technology as I can take advantage of glowing effects (to represent computer
                    screens, etc). On the last board, I made gridlines to help myself code the flexbox layout and
                    understand where to place elements.

                <p>
                    I experimented a lot with interactions using over and animation delay to introduce information and
                    allow a playful aspect to the poster. I felt it brought a 2D object to life using glow, a cursor
                    trail, scale, and transitions. When scrolling down to the second page, I wanted to try parallax
                    scrolling using CSS. It was cool to see the scale/fade in change on the scroll, as it can create an
                    engaging experience. The images below show interactions.
