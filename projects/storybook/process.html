        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          Through the many prompts, I thought, “What was a memorable event from your holiday break?” piqued my interest.
          For a long time, I have always yearned for a cat and would bother my parents to adopt one. My cousin received
          a cat before the winter break but had to go to Hawaii with her partner for vacation. It was an exciting
          moment, so I thought to display my thrill through this storybook process. First, I created a storyboard of the
          main storyline, from receiving a text to meeting the cat. </p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <p>
          Additionally, I liked the idea of exploring choices when visiting the 2023 cohort students' storybook. Instead
          of having a direct narrative, I added different outcomes when the user clicks on an unexpected option. I
          organized the flow of the storybook on Figma, which helped me decide how many pages I should have. </p>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>
          Along the coding process, W3Schools helped me with building shapes and animations. For example, it was helpful when I needed to create buttons for the phone display when selecting yes or no. Tutorials were excellent references as I was able to experiment with shapes by adjusting numbers and colours. Moreover, adding animation to the storybook made the narrative dynamic and interactive. I thought the fade-in effect with the messages was effective in keeping viewers engaged.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          With lots of practice, I understand better how to build shapes and experiment with complex objects. Moreover, I discovered some parts of my code may be excessive or inefficient when using position in every class. I understand I can use CSS grids to keep objects centred or organized. Thus, I run into a responsive issue on the first page if one's display is a different size. With more iterations, I hope to understand conventions and simplify coding processes.
