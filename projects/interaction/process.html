                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the research, I analyzed the different utilizations of the function "click" in
                    diverse interfaces. Normally, they help users navigate the website with buttons to reveal more
                    information. This area. na channel filled with resources inspired me to use sound and click to
                    trigger artwork.

                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    I took inspiration from objects, as inspiration, to sort out functions that give an output. For
                    example, I thought of the clock and that clicking would trigger a ticking noise. However, I settled
                    with a boombox, which also emits sounds, but I wanted to visualize it with circles. My initial
                    drawing on Figma involved too many details, making it challenging for the user to find what to
                    interact with. I decided to simplify my design and mainly focus on the functionality of the
                    interaction.

                <h2>Interaction</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to visualize the concept of sound with sound waves of circles from clicking on the yellow
                    speakers. Although it was difficult, I decided to outline the steps necessary to reach this outcome.
                    First, I needed to find out how to create this ripple effect. I searched for YouTube videos and
                    found "CSS Ripple Effect Animation" by csPoint. The tutorial helped me understand how to animate
                    with time, infinite, and linear. From there, I incorporated JavaScript that listens to the user
                    click on the yellow speakers, which triggers the ripples. It creates a new div with the class waves
                    to display the sound waves rippling out. After 3 seconds, the variable newWave would remove the
                    waves.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    Interaction

                    For music, I created two arrays to display the music and the name. I used a variable (currentSong)
                    to keep track of the music numbers as I put three in an array. The song index aligns with the
                    display names, which works well for assigning the correct song and name. When the user clicks on the
                    yellow rectangle, it adds 1 to currentSong variable that switches the array to the next song.
