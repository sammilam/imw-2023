                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, I was certain to create a pixel-themed website. However, I encountered a few other
                    inspirations that paved the way for this index today. Through this research process, I glanced at a
                    new past student's work and admired the reference to real-life designs. I especially enjoyed the
                    process of the vending machine to select and navigate to their unique sites. I compiled many
                    references into an Are.na channel and began to search for an aesthetic. Looking through Pinterest, I
                    saw illustrations of food art that I hoped to try. Therefore, I created a bakery as a layout for my
                    index, as my fav icon is Jiji from Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service and a motivation to draw.
                    Additionally, I drew illustrations of Chinese bakery goods that reference my Chinese heritage. Each
                    item represents an exercise, project, or reading that takes the user to its' designated place.

                <h2>Figma Sketching</h2>
                <p>
                    When designing the Figma digital sketches, I wanted an intro page that transitions to the main area.
                    The intro page would animate in my title and encourage the user to ring the bell as a reflection of
                    entering a Chinese bakery. Towards the main page, there are multiple rows to select from, and when
                    clicked upon, the glass will disappear. Revealing the buns, the user can view luxury goods while
                    navigating my progress from the beginning of the course. As you can see, there are overlapping
                    shapes, which I tend to struggle to code. Whether I used flexbox or position, I had to simplify
                    specific areas to make this realistic and intact.

                <p>
                    These are all the drawings I created from photo references. I enjoyed this process as I accomplished
                    a desire through a school project. I ensured each image was relative to size 2 inches by 2 inches.

            <h2>Code Execution</h2>
            <p>
                In this example, I simplify the container with no trapezoid because of its complexity with overlapping
                shapes and images. For the three assignments, I made a card named "Recipe" to reflect the procedure of
                creating the outcome, as illustrated through baking analogies.

            <h2>Interaction</h2>
            <p>
                On the Intro page, I luckily encountered https://animista.net/ as they helped provide CSS animations
                that I can modify and employ for my Index. For interaction on the main page, the user can hover over
                each bread, and they will shake in response. It is simple but enhances the user's experience of
                exploring with each bread/pastry. Moreover, I coded the window to hide and disappear after clicking so
                the anchor tag is properly placed within each image. Finding difficulty with layering shapes, I realize
                that position relative and absolute can be helpful in these situations. I can hide and delete the class
                using Javascript once the user clicks the window.
