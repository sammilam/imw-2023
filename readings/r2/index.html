        <h1> Reading 2: What Screens Want<br> What is the thesis of this article? </h1>
        <p> Frank Chimero's "What Screens Want" emphasizes our creative ability to create abstraction, responsiveness,
            and
            interactions beyond real-world objects on the web. As an ever-growing society, Chimero spoke about the
            attitudes
            toward what is real. When software imitates the visual and function of notepads, calendars, and paper, they
            become accepted as they are more efficient. Chimero stated, "we no longer buy the thing we want, we buy the
            shape of the thing we prefer," in which associations tie strongly to the visual and use of the items. What
            screens do is change and have a multitude of affordances. Chimero answers his question that screens should
            want
            what we want. The web is fully capable of becoming responsive and dynamic in its' potential to display
            movement
            compared to print on a paper sheet. Humans should not adapt to technology but to produce them in many ways
            we
            desire. Chimero emphasizes that there is not a correct approach to web creation. Instead, we should build it
            for
            community engagement, creativity, and transparency.

        <h1>Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? </h1>

        <p>
            I may have mixed emotions about both flat and skeuo in specific circumstances. I tie skeuo design closely to
            nostalgia because of its popularity at the beginning of technology. Although I do not hold against either
            ideological camp and am open to options, I stand closely to flat design due to its simplistic nature and
            functionality. I find a satisfying sensation when I see "clean" and "modern," which is flat design's overall
            aesthetic. Abstraction may be simpler to understand, yet harmful to be the overall representation of the
            item we
            refer to. Chimero exemplifies distortion, where he forgot the Earth is a sphere because of a relationship
            between a digital map and the world. I believe there are certain conditions to use skeuo or flat design in
            effectively communicating accurate and dynamic information. Overall, I agree with Chimero that design
            strategies
            depend on their context and how we want to display content. As for where I stand, I typically strive toward
            flat
            design based on what I notice in current trends and how I experience instinctual approaches when
            encountering
            interfaces.

            What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from
            filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.


        </h1>

        <p>
            Eadweard Muybridge's Zoopraxiscope is a bottle movement device that creates movement by setting time when
            printing high-speed photographs in front of a light. It is one of the origins of screens, using travelling
            light
            and motion. It presents dynamic and immersive experiences through continuous movement and storytelling from
            beginning to end.

            I believe games also inspire digital design in approaches to how the user can interact with the web. By
            nature,
            games convey success or failure and offer numerous options to play. It carries the intrinsic value of users
            by
            intriguing curiosity and enjoyment by enforcing rules or challenges for the audience to overcome. I believe
            these aspects are carried in digital design to introduce content and allow the users a choice of direction
            and
            pace when exploring interfaces. For instance, users can accumulate rewarding points each time they complete
            a
            book, enabling them to make additional purchases from the store. Gamification in interfaces maintains
            engagement
            and immersion within a user's experience.
