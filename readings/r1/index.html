            Reading 1: A Handmade Web
            <br>
            What is the thesis of this article?
        </h1>

        <p>
            J. R. Carpenter's “A Handmade Web” defines a handmade web, critiquing the use of a website influenced by
            capitalist society to inform and commercialize content. Reminiscing from the 1990s, Carpenter describes the
            web as a lively place with multiple unique personalities, with no restraint in structure or rules. Carpenter
            describes ‘handmade’ as websites coded by hand, where pages “challenge conventions of reading, writing,
            design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.” With every instance she uses the term ‘handmade web,’
            she brings positive arguments about the effects of designing the web by hand. It is the equivalent of making
            a personal handmade object like zines, artist books, and more. In a way, it has a one-of-a-kind nature and
            significance behind an author's works. However, with the web becoming less ‘humane’ and more robotic with
            its acts of services, the presentation of websites is overlooked and draws emphasis on information.
            Carpenter evokes the term ‘handmade web’ to illustrate the noise from commercialized content that distanced
            the significance of expressing our identity, creativity, and individuality online.
        </p>
        <!-- QUESTION 2 -->
        <h1>
            2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?
        </h1>

        <p>
            Our presence on the internet with ‘handmade’ webs resists the conventional modernized corporate websites
            used for information and commercialization. Our voices are covered and overshadowed by companies that target
            users to buy their products. In a digital age where advertisements pop up on websites and before watching a
            YouTube video, we have to wait after two ads. We lose our authority on the internet to corporate companies
            that gain profit. Websites with services now enforce subscription fees to listen to music, watch videos, and
            read journals. The shift to a monetized model made all websites look the same, losing the liveliness and
            enjoyment of one’s curiosity about the physical body of websites. The internet today has become a platform
            to sell a product to users. However, with ‘handmade’ webs, we can bring back active engagement for intrinsic
            value and personal interest in building a community with similar interests. The internet should be a place
            to learn and grow, not a place for commercialized content persuading one to think that a product is
            beneficial.

        <!-- QUESTION 3 -->
        <h1>
            3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the "physicality" of the
            web?
        </h1>

        <p>
            As an artist, I often post art online to be part of and support a community. For instance, art trades are
            exchanged between two people to draw something for another person. We create our artwork offline and
            reconnect and celebrate the collaboration. For this example, the physicality of the web is the platform
            space for online communication and community bonding. The online platform should not enforce rules but be a
            place for open uses that users create themselves. In a way, it allows me to be conscious of my online
            presence. Being part of a community on a big platform like Instagram demonstrates my presence as an author
            from the posts I create. There are comments, viewership, and likes that other people interact with,
            acknowledging one’s presence on the web. However, this is somewhat dependent on a big website to host an
            online identity. I became aware of the physicality of the web-based on active viewer engagement within a
            small community of similar hobbies.
